I developed a Facial Recognition Attendance System (FRAS) as part of my final year project at Coventry University. This system leverages advanced facial recognition technology to automate the attendance process, ensuring accuracy and efficiency. By utilizing a combination of Python, OpenCV, and machine learning algorithms, FRAS can identify and verify individuals in real-time, marking their attendance with minimal human intervention. This project enhanced my skills in software development, machine learning, and data analysis, while also providing practical experience in handling complex system integration and user interface design.
